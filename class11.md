# Images Practical Information

### Images

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box. **Example:**

```
body {

background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}

```
###### The background-repeat property can have four values:

**1.repeat:** The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isnâ€™t used).

**2.repeat-x:** The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).

**3.repeat-y:** The image is repeated vertically only.

**4.no-repeat:** The image is only shown once.

**5.fixed:** The background image stays in the same position on the page.

**6.scroll:** The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

###### Notes:

* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

* You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
