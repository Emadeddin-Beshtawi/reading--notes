Hello, my name is Emadeddin Beshtawi, I'm 25 years old, I have a bachelor degree in Mathematics. Currently, I'm in this course to boost my skills in programming.

I think the **Growth Mindset** is a way to describe the underlying beliefs people have about *learning* and *intelligence*. For instance, when students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger.
Iâ€™m strongly believe in three reminders to keep myself in **Growth Mindset**:

1)	By facing the challenges bravely,

3)	taking a step deeper into authenticity,

5)	cultivating a sense of purpose.

# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## We can format text by Markdown
- **Creat headings by add one to six # (e.g. #,##,###,...)**

..........

- **To creat your lists:** 
  - ##### Sometimes you want numbered lists:
1) One
2) Two
3) Three

   - ##### Sometimes you want bullet points:
* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

..........

- **If you want to embed images, this is how you do it (without spaces):**
##### ! [Alt Text] (url) 

..........

- **To add links, this is how you do it (without spaces):**
##### [name] (web-url)
