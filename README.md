I think the **Growth Mindset** is a way to describe the underlying beliefs people have about *learning* and *intelligence*. For instance, when students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger.
Iâ€™m strongly believe in three reminders to keep myself in **Growth Mindset**:
1)	By facing the challenges bravely,
2)	taking a step deeper into authenticity,
3)	cultivating a sense of purpose.
