# JavaScript

## What's JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## JavaScript Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

 * Using **var**
 * Using **let**
 * Using **const**
 * This chapter uses **var**.

### Variables

Variables are containers for storing data (values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

Example

var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y;

From the example above, you can expect:

 * x stores the value 5
 * y stores the value 6
 * z stores the value 11

 ## JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called **text strings**.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of **numbers** and **strings**.

**Strings** are written inside **double or single quotes**. **Numbers** are written **without quotes**.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be **treated** as a text **string**.

Example

**var** pi = 3.14;

**var** person = "John Doe";

**var** answer = 'Yes I am!';

## JavaScript Arithmetic

As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like **=** and **+**:

Example

var x = 5 + 2 + 3;

You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:

Example

var x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
