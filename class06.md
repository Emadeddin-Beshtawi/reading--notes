# Objects overview

Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

## Object Literals

An object literal is “flat”. You create it, you add properties and methods to it, and all of those properties and methods are public. You can mutate any members of that object at any time. A JavaScript object literal does not, by nature, provide private scope. But any of the members of an object literal can certainly be a function that is capable of private scope. Object literals are useful because they allow you to create clean name-spaced code that is easy to pass around and consume.

# Document Object Model

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page

* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
