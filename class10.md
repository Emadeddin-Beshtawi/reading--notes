### Error Handling and Debugging

Errors, bugs, and therefore debugging are a part of life for a programmer. As the saying goes, if you haven’t made any mistakes, then you aren’t trying hard enough.

Dealing with errors actually involves two very different processes: 

* **Error Handling** 

Error handling is a combination of coding and methodology that allows your program to anticipate user and other errors. It allows you to create a robust program. Error handling does not involve weeding out bugs and glitches in your source code, although some of the error handling techniques covered in this chapter can be used to great advantage at the debugging stage. In general, error handling should be part of your overall program plan, so that when you have an error-free script, nothing is going to bring it to a screeching halt. With some sturdy error handling in place, your program should be able to keep running despite all the misuse that your users can—and certainly will—throw at it.

* **Debugging**

on the other hand, involves finding errors and removing them from your program. There are many types of errors that you can unwittingly build into your scripts, and finding them provides hours of fun for all the family. Errors can result from:

**Including** language features or syntax that the scripting engine does not support within the script.

**Failing** to correctly implement the intent of the program or some particular algorithm. This occurs when, although code is syntactically correct and does not generate any errors, it produces behavior or results other than those you intend.

**Including** components that contain bugs themselves. In this case, the problem lies with a particular component, rather than with your script, which “glues” the components together.
