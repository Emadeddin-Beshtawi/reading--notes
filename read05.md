## Comparison operators

| Operator	  |  Description	 | Examples returning true  |
|---|---|---|
| Equal (==)  |  Returns true if the operands are equal.	 |  3 == var1 ; "3" == var1 ; 3 == '3' |
| Not equal (!=)  | Returns true if the operands are not equal.  | var1 != 4 ; var2 != "3"  |
| Strict equal (===)  |  Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. |  3 === var1 |
|  Strict not equal (!==) |  Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type. |  var1 !== "3" |
| Greater than (>)  |  Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand. | var2 > var1  |
| Greater than or equal (>=)  | Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.  |  var2 >= var1 |
|  Less than (<) |  Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	 |  var1 < var2 |
|  Less than or equal (<=) |  Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. | var1 <= var2  |
