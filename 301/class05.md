# Thinking in React

**React** is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.

One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.


### Build A Static Version in React

To build a `static version` of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a `static version` of the app, you don’t need it.


### Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is **DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself.** Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.


### Identify Where Your State Should Live

**For each piece of state in your application:**

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

* If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.


### Add Inverse Data Flow

We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, `FilterableProductTable` will pass callbacks to `SearchBar` that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the `onChange` event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by `FilterableProductTable` will call `setState()`, and the app will be updated.
